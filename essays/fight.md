## What did Typescript do such that it got into a fight?

Typescript is in war with me; the syntax of the new language is quite challenging. I have been exposed to a couple of programming languages, such as Python, C, C++; however, Javascript and Typescript are different. After learning Python, C and C++ were quite a challenge to learn, especially because they are such low-level languages (C and C++). After beating C and C++ down, here we go with Typescript. Its new syntax, nuances, and structure made me get into another round of fights with a new programming language. It is not impossible to learn the language, and I cannot wait to learn more about it.

## Any advantage that I have in the fight?

Well, not much. I have only worked with Python, C, and C++. Javascript had to be learned in less than a day on my end, due to the fact that this class is for computer engineers, so for them, it was just a refresher. However, for me, *Codeacademy*'s 10-hour course was the first time I had dealt with Javascript. For Typescript, I had even less time; *W3school* had a short tutorial about Typescript, which was based on the idea that the person doing the tutorial knows Javascript at a skillful level. The key concept for programming is not necessarily the language you code in, but more like the logic that you have to have, and a good understanding of the problem you are trying to tackle, in my opinion. I feel like I have the right logic on my advantage, it is the syntax that gets me. So at the end of the day, I can just be smarter in the fight; I don't have to be stronger than the Typescript compiler. Okay, maybe that is not true:)

## The athlete's training

Training for the final fight against Typescript is quite far away; it will take place at the end of the semester. Our coach, Chad Morita, makes sure that everyone is ready for the battle by giving us WOD's, "workout of the day"-s. I think his methods are good; giving us problems with time limits represents real-life situations. However, the time constraint, and the fact that the workout has to be done in class, makes things more stressful, which might not benefit every code warrior or wahine. I like the idea of working in groups and coding together. I feel like I need more time to think about the problem than the time given for a WOD. However, if it was easy, then everyone would be able to do it, which is not fun. I like to compete and fight the problems that seem challenging, giving me more experience overall.

At the end of the day, every coding problem is just a workout; there is no such thing as failing, just learning:)
