## The importance of asking questions in the right way

Asking a good question is important in the everyday life. There are many pronlems that has to be solved, some of them are easier, some of them 
are more difficult, and one may need some help to tackle these problems. Therefore, asking questions in the right way is crucial; if someone ask a question, then from that it can
be easily decided if the person actually put effort into trying to solve the problem, or he/she did not. There is a phrase that I was told by my Dad when I was youg that "Having the right questions implies that you are already halfway to solve the problem", and in my opinion he is right. 

Asking the right questions applies even more for software engineers. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), a question-and-answer website for keyboard warriors, is a common placce to ask questions and get informed in case someone is stuck with a problem.


## How to get help from Stackoverflow in case we are stuck with a problem

Understanding what is not working, exploiting majority of the options to find the answer, do some digging to get to the solution is crucial to state the right question, and to get the attention of those who are willing to asnwer. These people who answer questions on Stackoverflow can easily see how much effort, time, and researh one invested into solving the given problem. 





## How to **NOT** to get an answer 

As it was mentioned above, the right way of stating the question, and showing that there is actually tear and sweat to get to the answer is crucial. The following question does not demonstrate time investment, nor effort, no nothing into the following question: 


### [How do I exit Vim?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim/11828573#11828573)

*I am stuck and cannot escape. It says:*
```
type :quit<Enter> to quit VIM
```
*But when I type that it simply appears in the object body.*

There are multiple reason this question is a "Stupid question", as [Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) would say: It can be seen here that the research
wasn't deep enough to solve this question. The archives of the forum or mailing list the person posted clearly wasn't read, nor researched, the experimentation of getting to the solution is not sufficient. Furthermore, there is a whole manual dedicated to use the command line, bash. It includes the basic text editors, such as *VIM* or *NANO*. 

Surprisingly, the answer turned out to be surprisingly informative, even though "stupid questions" tend to be disregarded or answered in a really short sentence.
