## Why to learn and understand coding as an engineer

Software engineering is part of our life, we use websites, chips, applications, machines on every day basis. We might not notice, however, major part of the engineering would struggle if software engineering wouldn't exists. Since I am new to this programming world, I am eager to learn more about it. As I talked about in my other essay, coding is not necessary about knowing the syntax of every program language, but understanding the problem and having the logic to solve it. 

## What do I enjoy about the random charcters following each other

My main interest as an electrical engineer is robotics, which inevitably includes coding as well. One of my projects is with [Team RoSE](https://youtu.be/sR2wBOrVhRw?si=H3Q2VTRIHe_cz-SL), where other than building a battery, we have to program microcontrollers and arduinos, which move separate DC or stepper motors which brings us to the point: it is really interesting to see that with the help of few lines of code, a big piece of metal, wires, and circuitboards come to life. Also, part of the missions for team RoSE is autonomous navigation, which for outsiders might look like that the rover is controlled by AI, which is not the case. So even though I get lost in the syntax of the code, or I mess up a couple lines, in the end, the outcome is always paying off for the pain and the struggle that I went through. 

## What's next on the menu? 

I want to improve my technical skills: have already been exposed to python, C, and C++ as program languages, but there are a lot mroe to learn. For robotics, ROS2 is inevitable for control and autonomous navigation.  On the other hand, we live in the world of Javascript and Typescript, the websites, webapps are built on these languages. Another really important skill to learn is Git, which was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and Github. These free tools make the programming world faster, more convinient. Github specifically serves as a host for Git repository teams to store their code in a [centralized location](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/git-vs-github#:~:text=GitHub%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20serves%20as%20a,copies%20of%20a%20Git%20repository.). Since I live more like in the world of circuits, rather than code, there is a lot more to go for me.

## Personal goals

My personal goal with specifically Javascript and Typescript is to build a webapp, where the definition creating of the swim practices will be redefined. Since I am part of the UH Swim and Dive team, I already have the knowledge *what* to put on the website, learning Javascript and Typescript will help me *how* to put the webapp together. It is a long journey to get there, but I am excited to learn more about the field of sofware engineering. 

team collaboration!!
