# **Final Project Idea**

## **Proposers' Names**

## **Overview**  
At UH MƒÅnoa, students rush to take notes, struggling to keep up with lectures. Alexa took great notes, but her friend Noah often missed key details. Before an exam, he searched Laulima and group chats, only to find scattered, incomplete notes.  

"What if there was one place where UH students could share notes for every class?" Tokyo wondered.  

That idea became **NoteHub-MƒÅnoa**, a website where students can:  
- Upload and access notes for any UH course.  
- Rate notes based on clarity and usefulness.  
- Comment and discuss with classmates.  

No more last-minute panic. No more missing details. Just a growing library of knowledge, built by UH students, for UH students.

## **The Problem**  
Students looking for class notes prefer those taken by peers who attended the same class. Unfortunately, these notes are often hard to find, scattered across different platforms, or hidden behind ads and paywalls, making it difficult to access reliable study materials.  

## **The Solution**  
A dedicated platform where students can upload and access class notes, categorized by:  
- **Course**  
- **Professor**  
- **Semester**  

This ensures that students get the most relevant and high-quality notes tailored to their specific course.

## **Beyond the Basics**  

### **üí¨ Comment Section**  
Students can discuss notes, ask questions, and provide additional explanations. The original uploader can also clarify any doubts.  

### **‚≠ê Star Rating System**  
- Students must **rate notes** after accessing them.  
- **Rating Scale:** 1-5 stars (1 = Not Useful, 5 = Very Useful).  
- Average ratings are displayed on the viewing page.  

### **üéØ Points-Based System**  
- Users earn **points** based on the star ratings received on their uploaded notes.  
- **Unlocking notes requires points:** The higher the rating of a note, the more points it costs to unlock.  
- This incentivizes students to contribute **high-quality, readable, and accurate notes.**  
- Students who don't contribute notes will have fewer points to access high-rated notes.  

### **Final Thought**  
The **more and better** notes a student takes, the **more access** they get to others' high-quality notes. This fosters a collaborative and enriching learning environment at UH MƒÅnoa.
