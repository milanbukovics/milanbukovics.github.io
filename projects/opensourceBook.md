I am collaborating with Boris Murmann on an interactive book project centered on MOSFET amplifier design. This initiative aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for students and professionals by integrating theoretical explanations with practical applications. The book focuses on enhancing understanding of MOS amplifier stages and their design, offering an educational tool for both beginners and advanced learners in the field of microelectronics.

Using Markdown and Quarto, I further develop the book's format and incorporate embedded Python programs for hands-on learning. These interactive tools allow readers to visualize and simulate circuit behavior, deepening their grasp of basic microelectronics concepts. My contributions emphasize creating an engaging and accessible educational resource that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical circuit design.
